Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

We would like to thank you for considering our manuscript, and the reviewers for their constructive comments. We note that the reviewers found that our article, referred to as article id 2021-201, was an "accurate" and "useful" comparison of R packages estimating the parameters of GMMs by means of the EM algorithm.


We acknowledge that reviewers notably suggested that we improve upon our notations, shorten our statements and that we extend our analysis to the multivariate setting. We revised our manuscript accordingly and answer point-by-point below, using a blue colour to clearly distinguish from the reviewers' comments. You will find the complete response to the reviewers in the zip archive, under "Response_to_the_reviewers__Gaussian_mixtures_in_R.pdf" document.
