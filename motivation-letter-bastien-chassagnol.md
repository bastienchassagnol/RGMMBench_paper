Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

We would like to thank you for considering our manuscript, and the reviewers for their constructive comments. We note that the reviewers found that our article,, was an "accurate" and "useful" comparison of R packages estimating the parameters of GMMs by means of the EM algorithm.


We acknowledge that reviewers notably suggested that we improve upon our notations, shorten our statements and that we extend our analysis to the multivariate setting. We revised our manuscript accordingly and answer point-by-point below, using a blue colour to clearly distinguish from the reviewers' comments. You will find the complete response to the reviewers in the zip archive, under "Response_to_the_reviewers__Gaussian_mixtures_in_R.pdf" document.

Dear Professor Cook,

I hope this email finds you well. We would like to thank you again for considering our manuscript, and the reviewers for their constructive comments.

We have finally ended the revision of our manuscript, taking into account all the comments from the reviewers. We submitted it to the required Google form, with the corresponding submission ID 2021-201, while making it consistent with the new R Journal style. Notably, you will find any additional data required to regenerate the figures in folder data, and the response to the reviewers in review folder. 

We kindly apologised for the delay: incorporating a benchmark of multivariate distributions, as suggested per reviewer #2, while shortening the length of the main corpus without lose of consistency and integrating the new Rmarkdown style with both a Latex and html output took longer than expected.

we sincerely hope that you will forgive our delay, and we thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Bastien CHASSAGNOL
